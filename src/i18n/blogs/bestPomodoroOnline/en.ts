      intro: 'In 2026, staying focused can be challenging. Between constant notifications, back-to-back meetings, and the constant temptation to check your phone, deep work has become rare. Yet a simple method has existed for nearly forty years: the Pomodoro Technique. And today, the best online Pomodoro tools transform this approach into modern tools, accessible from any browser, without installation. This article guides you through an objective comparison of available solutions, to help you find the one that truly matches your way of working.',

          content1: 'An online Pomodoro is a timer accessible directly from your web browser, without requiring download or installation. Unlike mobile or desktop applications, you can access it from any internet-connected device: computer, tablet, or even smartphone via the browser.',
          content2: 'The main difference with a mobile app lies in accessibility. An online Pomodoro works wherever you have a browser, making it particularly practical for remote work or when you regularly switch devices. No need to sync your data between multiple applications: everything is centralized in the cloud.',
          content3: 'The advantages are numerous. First, simplicity: a simple link is enough to start. Then, compatibility: regardless of your operating system, Windows, macOS, Linux, everything works. Finally, updates are automatic: you always get the latest version without any intervention on your part.',

            title: 'Simplicity',
            content: 'A good online Pomodoro must be intuitive from the first use. If you have to spend twenty minutes understanding how to start a session, you\'ve already lost the essential: your momentum. The interface must be clean, buttons clearly identifiable, and starting a session should not require more than two clicks. Avoid tools overloaded with features you\'ll never use: complexity kills productivity.',

          features: {
            title: 'Features',
            content: 'The basic features are simple: a timer, short and long breaks, and possibly an end-of-session sound. But some tools go further. Statistics allow you to visualize your progress over several days or weeks. Integrated task management avoids juggling between multiple applications. Customizable reminders help you maintain the rhythm. The question is not having the most features, but those that really serve you.',

You no longer work out of obligation, but to progress, to unlock the next level, to complete your badge collection.

            answer: 'The best free Pomodoro depends on your needs. If you\'re looking for simplicity, Pomofocus is excellent. If you want gamification to stay motivated, Pomocha offers a complete experience with missions, badges and trophies, while remaining free. If you need advanced statistics, Focus To-Do offers a solid free version. Test several tools to find the one that matches your way of working.',
          },
          q2: {
            question: 'How many Pomodoro per day?',
            answer: 'There is no magic number. Most people do between 4 and 8 Pomodoro per day, or 2 to 4 hours of focused work. What matters is not quantity but regularity. It\'s better to do 4 Pomodoro every day for a month than 10 Pomodoro one day and nothing the next. Start with 4 per day, and adjust according to your natural rhythm.',
          },
          q3: {
            question: 'Pomodoro 25 or 50 minutes?',
            answer: '25 minutes is the classic duration, but it\'s not an absolute rule. If you need more time to enter a deep flow state, 50 minutes may be more suitable. Some complex tasks require longer sessions. Test different durations and keep the one that works best for you. The important thing is to respect breaks, regardless of the chosen duration.',
          },
          q4: {
            question: 'Online Pomodoro or app?',
            answer: 'Online Pomodoro is more practical if you work on multiple devices or if you don\'t want to install software. The mobile app is better if you work mainly on your phone or if you want push notifications. Both approaches are valid. Some tools offer both: web version and mobile app, with synchronization.',
          },
          q5: {
            question: 'Does Pomodoro really work?',
            answer: 'Yes, the Pomodoro Technique works for several reasons. First, it divides work into manageable chunks, which reduces procrastination. Then, regular breaks maintain concentration over time. Finally, the timer creates positive urgency that helps you stay focused. Studies show that regular breaks improve productivity and reduce mental fatigue. Effectiveness, however, depends on your ability to respect breaks and not interrupt sessions.',
          },
          q6: {
            question: 'Can you use an online Pomodoro without an account?',
            answer: 'Yes, many online Pomodoro tools work without registration. You open the site and start. However, without an account, your data is not saved. If you close the tab, you lose your progress. To keep your statistics and synchronize between devices, you generally need to create an account. Most tools allow you to test without an account, then create an account if you want to save your data.',
          },
          q7: {
            question: 'What is the best break duration?',
            answer: 'The classic break is 5 minutes between each Pomodoro, and 15 to 30 minutes after 4 Pomodoro. But again, it\'s adaptable. If you feel that 5 minutes is not enough, increase to 10 minutes. The important thing is to really take a break: get up, move, look into the distance, don\'t stay in front of the screen. An effective break recharges your attention and improves the productivity of the next session.',
          },
          q8: {
            question: 'Is Pomodoro suitable for all types of work?',
            answer: 'Pomodoro works well for most tasks, but not all. Creative tasks that require deep flow can be interrupted by breaks. Very short tasks (less than 25 minutes) don\'t require Pomodoro technique. Meetings or client calls cannot be divided into Pomodoro. But for office work, writing, programming, studying, Pomodoro is generally very effective.',

If you need long-term motivation, gamification makes the difference. If you work on multiple devices, synchronization becomes essential.',
          content2: 'The best advice is to test several tools. Most are free and don\'t require registration for a trial.
